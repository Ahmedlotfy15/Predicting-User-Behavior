## Overview
This project aims to analyze user behavior data and build a machine learning system to classify and predict behaviors based on available variables. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and evaluation of various ML models to achieve optimal performance.

## Features
- Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Advanced feature engineering, including derived and categorized features.
- Model evaluation and optimization using various ML techniques.
- Interactive visualizations for data insights.

## Data Cleaning and Visualization
- **Missing Values**: Handled using imputation or record removal.
- **Outliers**: Detected and corrected using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
- **Visualization Tools**: Used box plots, KDE plots, and pie charts to explore data distribution.

## Modeling
- **Models Evaluated**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  - Gradient Boosting
- **Optimization**:
  - Used Grid Search to tune hyperparameters.
- Saved the best-performing model for future predictions.
